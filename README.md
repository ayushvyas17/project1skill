I am thrilled to present my project  “Collegopedia” – a browser for other projects.
As we all know, it becomes hectic to find different projects for work or reference, that’s why I created a solution that simplifies the process and streamlines the workflow.
With my project, you can quickly and easily browse through all of your as well as other’s  existing projects in one convenient platform. You can sort and search for projects, view their details and configurations, and open them directly from the browser. This saves your time and helps you stay organized, allowing you to focus on what really matters - creating amazing apps and websites.
This project can become boon for our college students for learning,studying and using the projects that has been made by students of the college itself.
It provides benefit to both user and developer. User can use and learn how it has been made by the access of its gitub link and it is usefull for developer to launch and get feedback for his project in our app.
By this project,beginners can also get idea that how things work. Some features I will add in future are as follows:
1. Applying sector wise segregation of projects .
2. Batch wise segregation 
3. user authentication using firebase
4. adding data of more colleges
